# Hi!
This repository's the home for all the Project Euler problems I've solved. Figured I'd keep track of them and my progress in one central place.

I'm using C++ and Python to learn more about the intricacies and details of each language, add more tools to my toolbox, and become more proficient with each along the way.

There's no real rhyme or reason to which language I use to solve a problem -- just however I feel in the moment and the specific way a possible solution forms in my brain. (sometimes it's Python just because I'm lazy, but shhhhhh)
